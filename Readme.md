## **Case Studies**  

### **1. Digital Infrastructure & ERP Development**  
**Organization:** Primeasia University, Bangladesh  
**Role:** Lead Developer & Digital Transformation Engineer  

#### **Situation**  
Primeasia University relied on **manual, paper-based processes** for admissions, finance, and academic records, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays.  

#### **Challenge**  
- No centralized system for **data tracking or reporting**.  
- Administrative workflows were **time-consuming** (e.g., student registration took ~2 weeks).  
- Lack of integration between departments (finance, academics, HR).  

#### **Resolution**  
- Designed and deployed a **custom ERP system** using **Java EE, Spring Boot, and React**.  
- Automated **student enrollment, fee collection, and grade management**, reducing processing time by **50%**.  
- Integrated **real-time dashboards** for decision-making.  
- **Outcome:** Streamlined operations, reduced paperwork, and improved cross-department collaboration.

### **2. Sales Engine POS & Retail Management System**  
**Organization:** Quest Consultancy, Bangladesh  
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer & Embedded Systems Integrator  
**Technologies Used:**  
- **Backend:** Java EE, Spring Boot, REST API, Node.js  
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf, AJAX, Embedded JavaScript (EJS)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, SQL (Stored Procedures)  
- **Embedded Systems:** Custom POS hardware (barcode scanners, receipt printers)  
- **Networking:** Intranet deployment, HTTPS/SSL encryption  
- **Other:** OAuth2 for authentication, WebSockets for real-time updates  

#### **Situation**  
A retail chain with **12+ physical stores** relied on legacy desktop POS systems with **no centralization**, leading to:  
- Disconnected inventory management (stock levels updated manually).  
- Sales data siloed in offline databases, requiring nightly batch syncs.  
- No real-time analytics or employee performance tracking.  

#### **Challenge**  
1. **Hardware Integration:** Legacy barcode scanners and receipt printers used proprietary protocols.  
2. **Real-Time Sync:** Needed to sync sales data across stores via a **low-bandwidth intranet** (no cloud dependency).  
3. **Scalability:** System had to support **100+ concurrent transactions** during peak hours.  
4. **Security:** PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing.  

#### **Resolution**  
1. **Embedded Systems Integration:**  
   - Developed **custom drivers in C++** to interface with barcode scanners and thermal printers.  
   - Deployed **RESTful APIs (Spring Boot)** to bridge hardware and software layers.  

2. **Intranet-Centric Architecture:**  
   - Designed a **hybrid Java EE + Node.js backend**:  
     - Spring Boot handled **inventory management** and **sales processing**.  
     - Node.js managed **real-time dashboards** (WebSockets) for store managers.  
   - Used **PostgreSQL with row-level locking** to prevent race conditions during high-volume sales.  

3. **Real-Time Features:**  
   - **Thymeleaf + AJAX**: Dynamic UI updates (e.g., stock levels, discounts) without page reloads.  
   - **Automated Inventory Sync**: Triggers in PostgreSQL updated stock levels across all stores via intranet.  

4. **Security & Compliance:**  
   - OAuth2 for **role-based access** (cashiers vs. admins).  
   - **End-to-end encryption** for payment data (HTTPS + TLS 1.3).  

#### **Outcome**  
- **60% faster checkouts** due to barcode scanner automation and AJAX-driven UI.  
- **40% reduction in stock discrepancies** via real-time intranet sync.  
- **100% uptime** during peak sales (Black Friday, Eid holidays).  
- **Key Code Snippet** (Spring Boot REST API for inventory):

### **3. Medicine Demand Prediction System**  
**Organization:** UK-based Pharmaceutical Company (Contract)  
**Role:** Data Scientist  

#### **Situation**  
The client faced **frequent stockouts** of critical medicines due to **inaccurate demand forecasts**.  

#### **Challenge**  
- Historical sales data was **unstructured** (spread across Excel files).  
- Existing models had **<70% accuracy**.  
- Logistics team lacked **automated alerts** for low stock.  

#### **Resolution**  
- Developed a **machine learning model** (Python, Scikit-learn) analyzing **10+ years of sales data**.  
- Engineered features like **seasonality, prescription trends, and regional demand**.  
- Integrated **SMS/email alerts** for low stock.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - **94% prediction accuracy**.  
  - **57% fewer stockouts**.  
  - Reduced excess inventory costs by **30%**.

- **40% of customer inquiries** went unanswered overnight.  
- Support team spent **60% time** on repetitive questions (e.g., order status).  

#### **Resolution**  
- Trained a **NLP chatbot** (Python, Dialogflow) to handle **FAQs, order tracking, and returns**.  
- Integrated with **Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp**.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - **70% faster response time**.

### **5. Cloud-Native DevOps Deployment**  
**Organization:** RDGB Bangladesh  
**Role:** DevOps Engineer  

#### **Situation**  
Legacy deployments caused **frequent downtime** (~2 hours/week) and **scalability issues**.  

#### **Challenge**  
- Manual deployments led to **version conflicts**.  
- No CI/CD pipeline; **testing took 3+ days**.  

#### **Resolution**  
- Migrated to **AWS + Kubernetes** with **Jenkins CI/CD**.  
- Automated testing using **JUnit/Postman**.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - **Zero downtime deployments**.
